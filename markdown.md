> As a team we are going to build an online infrastructure for computational social scientists, social scientist, and citizens that will facilitate and centralize our understanding of online human interaction. We will create a database that will allow metadata specification to store, share, describe, and analyze data sets. This will help solve the problem of not being able to easily access the metadata, and now scientist and citizens can easily access it via the internet.

## Sprint 1
* Database  
We setup an account on MLab and hosted our database on Amazon Web Services. We created a MongoDB account and installed MongoDB on our computers. Created a database in MLab named it "swfg3" and created an admin user. Then connected our MLab and MongoDB using via Mongo shell. Logged into our database and started to insert dummy JSON data.

* [User Interface](http://ec2-35-160-238-84.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/final_project/index.html)  
Created home page, upload file page, search for json files, account information page, logout page using Themefisher Bootstrap templates.  

* User Acceptance Test  
Created google documents for user acceptance cases, test to insert files, update files and delete files.   

* Markdown File  
Created a markdown file
